        "b": "False"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Radix sort typically starts with the least significant digit (LSD) and progresses toward the most significant digit.",
        "b": "Correct. Radix sort starts with the least significant digit (LSD) and moves toward the most significant digit, ensuring stable sorting at each digit position."

      "question": "2. If there are N elements of b digits, how many buckets will be used in radix sort?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(N)",
        "b": "O(b)",
        "c": "O(10)",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The number of buckets depends on the radix (base), not the number of elements.",
        "b": "Incorrect. b represents the number of digits, not the number of buckets needed.",
        "c": "Correct. Radix sort uses 10 buckets (one for each digit 0-9) when sorting decimal numbers, regardless of N or b.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option c correctly identifies the number of buckets."
