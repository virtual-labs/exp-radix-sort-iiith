### Prerequisites of the Experiment

This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [The Notion of Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
   - [Time Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)
   - [Space Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity)
   - [Basics of Logarithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithm)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!
### Overview of the Experiment

  -  The aim of this experiment is to understand the Radix Sort algorithm, its time and space complexity, and how it compares against other sorting algorithms.
   - The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
