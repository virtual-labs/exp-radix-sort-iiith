		"a": "True",

	"correctAnswer": "b",
	"explanations": {
		"a": "Incorrect. Radix sort typically starts with the least significant digit (LSD) and progresses toward the most significant digit.",
		"b": "Correct. Radix sort algorithm starts with the least significant bit (LSD) and moves toward the most significant bit, ensuring stable sorting at each digit position."

	"question": "2. If there are N elements of b digits, how many buckets will be used in radix sort?",
	"answers": {
		"a": "O(N) ",

		"c": "O(10)",
		"d": "None of the above "
	},
	"correctAnswer": "c",
	"explanations": {
		"a": "Incorrect. The number of buckets depends on the radix (base), not the number of elements.",
		"b": "Incorrect. b represents the number of digits, not the number of buckets needed.",
		"c": "Correct. Radix sort uses 10 buckets (one for each digit 0-9) when sorting decimal numbers, regardless of N or b.",
		"d": "Incorrect. Option c correctly identifies the number of buckets."
