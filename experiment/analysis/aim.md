### Learning Objectives of this Module
In this module, we will look into :

   - **Time and Space Complexity** : We will learn about the running time of the sorting process.
   - **Stable sort and Comparison sort** : We will learn about what stable and comparison sorts are. Then we will see how radix sort is a stable, non-comparison sort.
   - **Applications** : We will compare radix sort with other sorting algorithms and see in which situations radix sort is the optimal approach to take.
