      "question": "1. What is the time complexity of Radix Sort? (n is the number of elements, d is the maximum number of digits in any element)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "O(n*d)",
        "b": "O(n+d)",
        "c": "O(n^2)",
        "d": "O(d)"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Radix sort processes each element (n) for each digit position (d), resulting in O(n*d) time complexity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The operations are multiplicative, not additive, across digits and elements.",
        "c": "Incorrect. O(n^2) is the complexity of comparison-based sorts like bubble sort, not radix sort.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The complexity depends on both the number of elements and digits, not just digits alone."

      "question": "2. Radix Sort has O(1) space complexity.",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Radix sort requires auxiliary arrays or buckets for storing elements during sorting, so it is not O(1).",
        "b": "Correct. Radix sort has O(n+k) space complexity, where n is the number of elements and k is the radix (typically 10), due to the auxiliary buckets needed."
