### Estimated Time

1 hour

### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, you will be able to do the following:

   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying Radix Sort
   - Understand RadixSort, the conditions under which it is preferred over other algorithms and the associated time and space complexity through interactive animations.
   - Compare Radix Sort with other sorting algorithms and realise it as a stable, non-comparison based sorting algorithm.
