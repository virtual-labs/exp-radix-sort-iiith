[{"question":"1. Given an array where numbers are in range from 1 to n<sup>6</sup>, which sorting algorithm can be used to sort these numbers in linear time?  ","answers":{"a":" Not possible to sort in linear time ","b":"Radix Sort  ","c":"Bucket Sort ","d":"Quick Sort  "},"correctAnswer":"b"},{"question":"2. If we use Radix Sort to sort n integers in the range (n<Sup>k/2</sup>,n<sup>k</sup>, for some k>0 which is independent of n, the time taken would be? ","answers":{"a":"Theta(n) ","b":"Theta(k.n) ","c":"Theta(n.logn) ","d":"Theta(n<Sup>2</sup>) "},"correctAnswer":"c"},{"question":"3. If there are n integers to sort, each integer has d digits, and each digit is in the set {1, 2, ..., k}, radix sort can sort the numbers in: ","answers":{"a":"O(k (n + d)) ","b":"O(d (n + k)) ","c":"O((n + k) lg d)  ","d":"O((n + d) lg k) "},"correctAnswer":"b"},{"question":"4.
