      "question": "1. Pick the incorrect option",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Radix sort uses buckets to hold numbers with the same value for the digit in consideration",
        "b": "Radix sort can perform better than bubble sort  ",
        "c": "Radix sort does not require any extra space ",
        "d": "Radix sort starts with the least significant bit  "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This statement is actually true - radix sort does use buckets (typically 10 buckets for digits 0-9), so this is not the incorrect option.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This statement is actually true - radix sort has better time complexity than bubble sort, so this is not the incorrect option.",
        "c": "Correct. This is the incorrect option. Radix sort requires extra space for buckets/arrays to hold elements during sorting, making it not an in-place algorithm.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This statement is actually true - radix sort typically starts with the least significant digit (LSD) and moves toward the most significant digit, so this is not the incorrect option."

      "question": "2. Which extra data structure is used in radix sort?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Heap ",
        "b": "Array ",
        "c": "Queue ",
        "d": "None of the above "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Heaps are used in heap sort, not radix sort.",
        "b": "Correct. Radix sort uses auxiliary arrays (buckets) to temporarily hold elements grouped by digit values during each pass of the algorithm.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While queues could theoretically be used, the standard implementation uses arrays.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Radix sort requires extra data structures, specifically arrays."

    {
      "question": "3. Radix Sort has worse space complexity than Bubble Sort ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True ",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Radix sort has O(N+K) space complexity due to auxiliary arrays, while bubble sort has O(1) space complexity as it's an in-place algorithm.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Radix sort does have worse space complexity than bubble sort."

      "question": "4. Radix sort is a generalization of which sorting algorithm",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bubble Sort ",

        "c": "Selection Sort ",
        "d": "Merge Sort "
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Radix sort is not related to bubble sort's comparison-based approach.",
        "b": "Correct. Radix sort is a generalization of counting sort, applying counting sort to each digit position from least to most significant.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Selection sort is a comparison-based algorithm unrelated to radix sort.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Merge sort uses a divide-and-conquer approach different from radix sort."

      "answers": {
        "a": "True ",
        "b": " False"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. Radix sort can achieve O(d*N) time complexity where d is the number of digits, which can be faster than comparison-based sorts' O(N log N) lower bound for certain inputs.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Radix sort can indeed perform better than comparison-based sorting algorithms in specific scenarios."
